# Predicting Fradulent Job Postings Using Naive Bayes Classification
Class: ISDS 7070

Authors: Youssuf Elnoamany, Arielle Laurent, Leopold Marx, Christopher Oâ€™Brien, and Luke Willson

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction

Our goal for this project is to minimize the false postive rate without having outstandingly high false negative rate. This would classify more observations as fake but it also minimizes the fraudulent observations that would be classifed as real.
